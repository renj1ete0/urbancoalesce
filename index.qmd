# About Me

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> I am Ren Jie, a Year 3 Information Systems undergraduate at the Singapore Management University, majoring in Digitalisation & Cloud Solutions and Urban Science. I also hold a Diploma in Architecture from Singapore Polytechnic, having a good understanding of the planning, design, policy and regulatory aspects of the built environment.
>
> My main interest is in urban science research, focusing in areas of sustainability and transport flows. I have summarised it in three key pointers:
>
> 1.  Understanding data generated by urban cities
> 2.  Analysing and drawing conclusions from data
> 3.  Coming up with actionable solutions against urban issues
>
> I believe that these skills will allow gaps in the current urban planning and design ecosystem be filled, closing the loop between the planner and the data scientist, allowing more insights to be effectively derived through a clearer understanding of both ends of the spectrum.
>
> My Urban Science second major is an encapsulates my academic journey and interests in the analysis, exploitation and application of data in the context of the city and built environment.

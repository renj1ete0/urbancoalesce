# About Me

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> I'm Ren Jie, a Year 3 Information Systems Undergraduate student at the Singapore Management University, majoring in Digitalisation & Cloud Solutions (SCIS) and Urban Science (CIS).
>
> My interests are in urban science and urban planning. I am excited to learn more about geospatial analytics from this course which will value-add to my individualised second major in Urban Science at the College of Integrative Studies, where I aim to utilise, integrate and interpret data from the city into innovative solutions for cities of the future.
